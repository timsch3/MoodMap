# MoodMap

This is currently only saving data using the local storage of the browser/device the site viewed on.

## Next steps:

- Make mood statistics clickable and show notes and other data

## Later

- Option to save in account instead of local storage
- Refresh today page when date changes (probable error: overwriting save data with data from yesterday because of useEffect firing first)
